@page rest_api_rules API Access Rules

API access rules in MantisBase use expression-based access control powered by the [**cparse**](https://github.com/VinGarcia/cparse) library. This can be customized allowing for simple to complex expression evaluation as rules for row data access.

> **NOTE THAT SOME SECTIONS ARE STILL WIP**


## Overview

MantisBase uses expression-based access control to secure API endpoints. Each table can define five types of access rules that are evaluated using the cparse expression evaluator.

## Rule Types

Every table supports five distinct access rule types:

| Rule Type | HTTP Method | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `listRule` | `GET /api/v1/{table}` | Controls who can list all records |
| `getRule` | `GET /api/v1/{table}/:id` | Controls who can view individual records |
| `addRule` | `POST /api/v1/{table}` | Controls who can create new records |
| `updateRule` | `PATCH /api/v1/{table}/:id` | Controls who can modify existing records |
| `deleteRule` | `DELETE /api/v1/{table}/:id` | Controls who can delete records | 

## Expression Context Variables

When evaluating access rules, MantisBase provides two main variable contexts:

### Authentication Context (`auth.*`)

Contains information about the authenticated user:

```javascript
auth.id        // User's unique identifier
auth.entity     // Table the user authenticated against (e.g., "users", "mb_admins")
auth.email     // User's email address
auth.name      // User's display name
// ... other user fields from the auth table
```

This information is queried on the fly, if user is not found, these fields will be `None`.

### Request Context (`req.*`)

Contains data from the current HTTP request body:

```javascript
req.body.title      // Field from request JSON body
req.body.user_id    // Field from request JSON body
// ... any other fields in the request

req.remoteAddr      // Request remote address
req.remotePort      // Request remote port
req.localAddr       // Request local address
req.localPort       // Request local port
```

## cparse Expression Evaluation

MantisBase uses the **cparse** library for expression evaluation. The `ExprEvaluator` class converts JSON data to cparse `TokenMap` format and evaluates boolean expressions.

### Supported Operators

cparse supports standard comparison and logical operators:

- **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- **Logical**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Grouping**: `()` for precedence

## Rule Examples

### Basic Authentication Rules

```javascript
// Only authenticated users can access
auth.id != ""

// Only users from specific table can access
auth.entity == "users"

// Only admins can access
auth.table == "mb_admins"  // Or leave blank > evaluates to admin only
```

### Ownership-Based Rules

```javascript
// Users can only access their own records
auth.id == req.body.user_id

// Users can only modify records they created
auth.id == req.body.created_by
```

### Role-Based Rules

```javascript
// Only admins or the record owner
auth.entity == "mb_admins" || auth.id == req.body.user_id

// Only premium users
auth.subscription_type == "premium"
```

### Complex Conditional Rules

```javascript
// Users can edit their own posts, or admins can edit any post
(auth.entity == "users" && auth.id == request.author_id) || auth.table == "__admins"

// Only allow updates during business hours (if you have a time field)
auth.entity == "mb_admins" || (req.status != "published" && auth.id == req.author_id)
```

## Setting Rules via API

### During Table Creation

```json
{
  "name": "posts",
  "type": "base",
  "listRule": "auth.table == 'users'",
  "getRule": "auth.id == request.author_id || auth.table == '__admins'",
  "addRule": "auth.table == 'users'",
  "updateRule": "auth.id == request.author_id",
  "deleteRule": "auth.table == '__admins'",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "title", "type": "string", "required": true},
    {"name": "author_id", "type": "string", "required": true}
  ]
}
```

### Updating Existing Table Rules

```json
{
  "listRule": "auth.table == 'users' && auth.verified == true",
  "getRule": "auth.id == request.author_id || auth.role == 'moderator'"
}
```

## Default Behavior

### Empty Rules
When a rule is empty or not specified, MantisBase requires admin authentication:

```javascript
// Empty rule defaults to:
auth.table == "__admins"
```

### System Tables
System tables (like `mb_tables` and `mb_admins`) always require admin access regardless of configured rules.

### System Tables
If you need a rule to make an endpoint public, there are many ways around, but a simple way is setting rule as `True`.
- `listRule = True` -> Evaluator evaluates always to true hence public access.
- Setting it to `False` is similar to admin only access.

## Testing Access Rules

You can test your access rules using the integration test patterns:

Example test setup:
```cpp
// Create table with specific rules
const nlohmann::json table_schema = {
    {"name", "test_permissions"},
    {"type", "base"},
    {"listRule", "auth.table == 'users'"},
    {"getRule", "auth.id == request.user_id"},
    {"addRule", "auth.table == 'users'"},
    {"updateRule", "auth.id == request.user_id"},
    {"deleteRule", "auth.table == '__admins'"}
};
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Restrictive
Begin with strict rules and gradually relax them as needed:
```javascript
// Start with admin-only
auth.table == "__admins"

// Then allow specific users
auth.table == "__admins" || auth.id == request.owner_id
```

### 2. Use Consistent Field Names
Establish consistent naming conventions for ownership fields:
```javascript
// Good: consistent naming
auth.id == request.user_id
auth.id == request.owner_id
auth.id == request.created_by

// Avoid: inconsistent naming across tables
```

### 3. Test Edge Cases
Always test your rules with different user types and scenarios:
- Unauthenticated users
- Users from different tables
- Admin users
- Record owners vs. non-owners


## Troubleshooting

### Rule Evaluation Errors
If a rule fails to evaluate, check the logs for cparse errors. Common issues:
- Typos in field names
- Missing parentheses for complex expressions
- Incorrect operator usage

### Access Denied Issues
When debugging access denied errors:
1. Verify the user is properly authenticated
2. Check that required fields exist in the auth context
3. Test the rule expression with known values
4. Ensure the rule matches the HTTP method being used

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Field Validation
Combine access rules with field validation for comprehensive security:
```json
{
  "addRule": "auth.table == 'users' && auth.verified == true",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "status", 
      "type": "string",
      "validator": "^(draft|published)$"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multi-Table Relationships
For tables with relationships, use consistent field naming:
```javascript
// Comments table referencing posts
auth.table == "users" && (auth.id == request.author_id || auth.id == request.post_author_id)
```
