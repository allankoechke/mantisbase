@page setup Setting Up MantisBase

Getting started with **MantisBase** is simple. You can use the prebuilt binaries for a quick start, or embed the source code directly into your own C++ project.

## 🧩 Installation Options

MantisBase is available in two formats:

- ✅ **Precompiled binaries** for **Windows** and **Linux** (64-bit)
    - You can find them in the [Releases section](https://github.com/allankoechke/mantisbase/releases).
  > _Currently, only 64-bit builds for Linux and Windows are provided. Support for other platforms is planned for future versions._
