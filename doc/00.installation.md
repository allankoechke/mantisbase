@page setup Setting Up MantisBase

Getting started with **MantisBase** is simple. You can use the prebuilt binaries for a quick start, or embed the source code directly into your own C++ project.

## 🧩 Installation Options

MantisBase is available in two formats:

- ✅ **Precompiled binaries** for **Windows** and **Linux** (64-bit)
    - You can find them in the [Releases section](https://github.com/allankoechke/mantisbase/releases).
  > _Currently, only 64-bit builds for Linux and Windows are provided. Support for other platforms is planned for future versions._

- 💻 **Source code** for embedding into your own C++ application
    - See the [Embedding Mantis](05.embedding.md) guide for details.

## ⚡️ Using Precompiled Binaries

Each release includes zipped binaries named like:

### 🔧 Setup Steps:

1. **Download** the appropriate zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/allankoechke/mantisbase/releases).
2. **Extract** it using your preferred archive tool.
3. Inside, you’ll find the `mantisbase` binary.

Place the binary wherever you want, then run it directly from the terminal.

## 🚀 Running MantisBase

Once extracted, run the app like this:

```bash
./mantisbase serve
```

This starts the MantisBase server on port 7070, bound to localhost. You can now access its REST API or embedded dashboard.

## 🎛️ Admin Dashboard

MantisBase includes a powerful web-based admin dashboard that provides a visual interface for managing your data. The dashboard is **essential** for development and data management:

- **Visual Data Management** - View, create, edit, and delete records through an intuitive interface
- **Schema Management** - Create and configure entity schemas without writing API calls
- **Access Control Configuration** - Set up access rules visually
- **Real-time Data Exploration** - Browse your data with search, filtering, and pagination

After creating an admin account (see [Quick Start Guide](QuickStart.md)), access the dashboard at `http://localhost:7070/mb`. The dashboard provides a complete GUI alternative to the REST API, making it perfect for non-technical users and rapid development.
