# Dockerizing MantisBase
There are many benefits of running applications in docker containers or generally, containeralization technologies. As such, `mantisbase` offers docker ready container support, with some limitations.

# Limitations
Docker support is limited to platform build, as such, provided builds are for `linux-amd64`, if you need `ARM` builds, you will need to build the project from source for now.
> Other platform support will be added, be sure to check project development for news. For now, we are focussing on building the core functionality till we have a stable base.

# Dockerfile
The repo provides a ready `Dockerfile` in the /docker container, which ready to go container. To run the container:

```bash
docker build -t mantisapp .
docker run -p 7070:80 --rm mantisapp
```

This will build then start the container, running on local port `7070` and exposed on port `80` within the container. The only catch here is, for every container restart, the dynamic data added is cleared out. To fix this, we need to mount a directory to our docker container.

Of interest, mount a directory to the following:
- `/mantis/data` for storing database files, logs, assets, etc.
- `/mantis/public` for any public site static data that should be served
- `/mantis/scripts` for any extensibility scripts. The entrypoint is a file `index.mantis.js` in this directory.

# Docker Compose
To package all into a simple interface, we can make use of `docker compose` file provided. This adds the file mounting out of the box if needed.

```shell
docker compose up --build
```

The command builds the image before running it.
